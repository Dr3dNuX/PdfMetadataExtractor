right now this is just an idea but i want to be able to exstract metadata from pdf files that dont have metadata on them
eg files from the internet or downloaded pdfs or homemade pdf files

right now all it does is open a pdf file convert it to a string split that string into a list then search that list
using key words and return if it found them or not
